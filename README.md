# Overview and Business Problem
***
The sports gambling industry is one of the fastest growing in America today. You cannot turn the television on to any sports channel without seeing an advertisement for one of the big sportsbooks. Whether it be Draftkings, FanDuel, BetMGM, Caesaers, Pointsbet or Barstool the list goes on and on and the industry is only going to keep growing on a more national stage as more and more states move to legalize it. There is one sport that is widely considered the most difficult to bet on and predict within this industry and that is Major League Baseball. In a season with 162 games where powerhouses regularly lose to teams they are considered to be far superior to it can be awfully difficult to figure out who to bet on and to turn a profit.
