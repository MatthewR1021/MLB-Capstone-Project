The sports gambling industry is one of the fastest growing in America today. You cannot turn the television on to any sports channel on tv without seeing an advertisement for one of the big sportsbooks. Whether it be Draftkings, FanDuel, BetMGM, Caesaers, Pointsbet or Barstool the list goes on and on and the industry is only going to keep growing on a more national stage as more and more states move to legalize it.
